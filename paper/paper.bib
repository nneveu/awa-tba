    abstract = {{The Advanced Photon Source (APS) is a 7 GeV storage ring light source that has been in operation for well over a decade. In the near future, the ring may be upgraded, including changes to the lattice such as provision of several long straight sections (LSS). Because APS beamlines are nearly fully built out, we have limited freedom to place LSSs in a symmetric fashion. Arbitrarily-placed LSSs will drastically reduce the symmetry of the optics and would typically be considered unworkable. We apply a recently-developed multi-objective direct optimization technique that relies on particle tracking to compute the dynamic aperture and Touschek lifetime. We show that this technique is able to tune sextupole strengths and select the working point in such a way as to recover the dynamic and momentum acceptances. We also show the results of experimental tests of lattices developed using these techniques}},

        technique for beam dynamics simulations is presented.
            The method is based on the discontinuous Galerkin
            (DG) formulation. It utilizes locally refined,
        non-conforming grids which are designed for high
            spatial resolution along the path of charged
            particle beams. Apart from this formulation, the
            paper introduces a class of general symplectic
            integrators which conserve discrete energy in a
            modified sense. Specialized split-operator methods
            with optimum dispersion properties in the
            direction of particle motion are, additionally,
        derived. The application examples given in the paper
            are performed in a high performance computing
            environment. They include the self-consistent
            simulation of the RF electron gun developed by the

The Characteristics of the most significant methods are summarized. Conclusions are drawn that reflect often-neglected ideas and applicability to engineering problems.

In this paper we explore the use of multiobjective genetic algorithms (MOGA) to find globally optimized lattice settings in a storage ring. Using the Advanced Light Source (ALS) for illustration, three examples of MOGA are shown and analyzed — (i) using 3 fit parameters to optimize the straight section betatron function and the natural emittance, (ii) using 3 fit parameters to optimize the photon brightness of bending magnet and insertion device source points in the lattice and (iii) a 6 parameter fit creating alternating high and low horizontal betatron functions in subsequent straight sections while still minimizing the natural emittance. Making use of one of the main benefits of MOGA, we also study the trade-offs in the optimization objectives between sets of optimal solutions.}},

    abstract = {We present a framework for high quality splatting based on elliptical Gaussian kernels. To avoid aliasing artifacts, we introduce the concept of a resampling filter, combining a reconstruction kernel with a low-pass filter. Because of the similarity to Heckbert's (1989) {EWA} (elliptical weighted average) filter for texture mapping, we call our technique {EWA} splatting. Our framework allows us to derive {EWA} splat primitives for volume data and for point-sampled surface data. It provides high image quality without aliasing artifacts or excessive blurring for volume data and, additionally, features anisotropic texture filtering for point-sampled surfaces. It also handles nonspherical volume kernels efficiently; hence, it is suitable for regular, rectilinear, and irregular volume datasets. Moreover, our framework introduces a novel approach to compute the footprint function, facilitating efficient perspective projection of arbitrary elliptical kernels at very little additional cost. Finally, we show that {EWA} volume reconstruction kernels can be reduced to surface reconstruction kernels. This makes our splat primitive universal in rendering surface and volume data.},

    abstract = {Particle accelerators are invaluable tools for research in the basic and applied sciences, in fields such as materials science, chemistry, the biosciences, particle physics, nuclear physics and medicine. The design, commissioning, and operation of accelerator facilities is a non-trivial task, due to the large number of control parameters and the complex interplay of several conflicting design goals. We propose to tackle this problem by means of multi-objective optimization algorithms which also facilitate massively parallel deployment. In order to compute solutions in a meaningful time frame, that can even admit online optimization, we require a fast and scalable software framework. In this paper, we focus on the key and most heavily used component of the optimization framework, the forward solver. We demonstrate that our parallel methods achieve a strong and weak scalability improvement of at least two orders of magnitude in today's actual particle beam configurations, reducing total time to solution by a substantial factor. Our target platform is the Blue {Gene/P} (Blue {Gene/P} is a trademark of the International Business Machines Corporation in the United States, other countries, or both) supercomputer. The space-charge model used in the forward solver relies significantly on collective communication. Thus, the dedicated {TREE} network of the platform serves as an ideal vehicle for our purposes. We demonstrate excellent strong and weak scalability of our software which allows us to perform thousands of forward solves in a matter of minutes, thus already allowing close to online optimization capability.},

    abstract = {Evolutionary computation is an area of computer science utilizing the mechanisms of biological evolution in computer problem solving. It is concerned with theoretical studies, design and application of stochastic optimization procedures, known as Evolutionary Algorithms ({EAs}). {EAs} have proven effective and robust in solving demanding optimization problems that are often difficult if not intractable to traditional numerical methods. They are nowadays widely applied in science, engineering, management, and other domains. However, a drawback of {EAs} is their computational complexity which originates from iterative population-based search of the solution space. On the other hand, processing a population of candidate solutions makes {EAs} amenable to parallel implementation that may result in significant calculation speedup. This chapter presents a parallel evolutionary computation framework developed for solving numerical optimization problems with one or more objectives, and evaluates its performance on a high-dimensional optimization task from industrial practice. The chapter starts with an introduction to optimization problems. It distinguishes between single- and multiobjective optimization and reviews the concepts needed to deal with multiobjective optimization problems, such as the dominance relation and Pareto optimality. Next, {EAs} as a general-purpose optimization method are described, with a focus on Differential Evolution ({DE}) which is a particular kind of {EA} used in our framework. Then, parallelization of {EAs} is discussed in view of known parallelization types and speedup calculation. The chapter continues with an introduction to the optimization problem in industrial continuous casting, used as a test problem in this work. Afterwards, the proposed parallel evolutionary computation framework is presented. The framework is based on {DE} and implemented on a cluster of personal computers. It is evaluated on single- and multiobjective variants of the casting optimization problem and the results are analyzed from the perspective of the problem domain and, in particular, the achieved speedup.},

            communication patterns to the network topology gains importance as
    systems grow to petascale and beyond. Such mapping is supported in
    parallel programming frameworks such as {MPI}, but is often not well

    and analyze and compare different practical topology mapping heuristics.
    We demonstrate an efficient and fast new heuristic which is based on graph
    similarity and show its utility with application communication patterns on
    real topologies. Our mapping strategies support heterogeneous networks and
    show significant reduction of congestion on torus, fat-tree, and the
    {PERCS} network topologies, for irregular communication patterns. We also
    demonstrate that the benefit of topology mapping grows with the network
        size and show how our algorithms can be used in a practical setting to
    optimize communication performance. Our efficient topology mapping
    strategies are shown to reduce network congestion by up to 80\%, reduce

This mechanism allows the fully parallel evaluation of arguments to a function, and has been shown to augment the expressive power of a {language.We} discuss an approach to a problem that arises in this context: futures which were thought to be relevant when they were created become irrelevant through being ignored in the body of the expression where they were bound. The problem of irrelevant processes also appears in multiprocessing problem-solving systems which start several processors working on the same problem but with different methods, and return with the solution which finishes first. This parallel method strategy has the drawback that the processes which are investigating the losing methods must be identified, stopped, and re-assigned to more useful tasks.},
