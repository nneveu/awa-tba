\section{EXPERIMENTS} \label{sec:experiments}

In this section we present numerical results of the validation benchmark and
  discuss a proof of concept application in the domain of particle
  accelerators.

\subsection{Optimizer Validation}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[text=black]
      \input{figures/hypervolume.tex}
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The hypervolume for a two-objective optimization problem
  corresponds to the shaded area formed by the dashed rectangles spanned by
  all points on the Pareto front and an arbitrary selected origin $p_o$.}
  \label{fig:hypervolume}
\end{figure}

To ensure that the optimizer works correctly we solved the benchmark
  problem (\ref{eqn:bench}).
To that end, we use a metric for comparing the quality of a Pareto
  front.
Given a point in the Pareto set, we compute the $m$ dimensional volume (for
  $m$ objectives) of the dominated space, relative a chosen origin.
We visualize this for $2$ objectives in Figure~\ref{fig:hypervolume}.
For further information and details of the implementation see~\cite{whbb:12}.
Figure~\ref{fig:pisa_bench} and the corresponding hypervolume values in
  Table~\ref{tbl:bench_rms_error}.
The reference Pareto front is clearly very well approximated.
It took a total of 1100 function evaluations to perform this computation.
The hypervolume of the reference solution ($0.6575$) for our benchmark was
  computed by sampling the solution provided in~\cite{hbwh:05}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{figures/valid_front}
  \caption{Variator benchmark after $1100$ function evaluations using binary
           crossover and independent gene mutations (each gene mutates with
           probability $p=\frac{1}{2}$) on a population of $100$
           individuals.}

\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
  \caption{Convergence of benchmark problem with errors relative to
    hypervolume of sampled reference solution.}
  \label{tbl:bench_rms_error}
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    tot.\ function  & hyper volume & relative error\\
    evaluations    & & \\
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    100  &  0.859753 & $3.076 \times 10^{-1}$ \\
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
    200  &  0.784943 & $1.938 \times 10^{-1}$ \\
    500  &  0.685183 & $4.210 \times 10^{-2}$ \\
    900  &  0.661898 & $6.689 \times 10^{-3}$ \\
    1100 &  0.657615 & $1.749 \times 10^{-4}$ \\
    \noalign{\smallskip}\hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

From Table~\ref{tbl:bench_rms_error} we deduce that we achieved satisfactory
  convergence to the sampled reference Pareto front after 1000 (plus the
  additional 100 evaluations for the initial population) function evaluations.


\subsection{Ferrario Matching Point}

As a verification and proof of concept we reproduce the Ferrario
  matching point discovered by Ferrario \textit{et~al.}~\cite{fcpr:00},
  by formulating the problem as a  multi-objective optimization problem.
Using the low-dimensional and fast nature of their new simulation code
  Homdyn~\cite{homdyn}, an extensive beam dynamics study was conducted.

One of the results of the study presented in \cite{fcpr:00} was the discovery
  of a novel working point.
The authors noticed that the second emittance minimum can profit from the
  additional emittance compensation in the accelerating traveling wave
  structure ensuring that the second emittance minimum occurs at a higher
  energy.
This property is attained if the beam emittance has a maximum and the root
  mean square (rms) beam size has a minimum at the entrance of the first
  accelerating traveling wave structure.
This behavior is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fer_match}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/ferrario_illustrated}
  \caption{Illustration of the Ferrario matching criteria: beam emittance
  attains a maximum and rms beamsize a minimum at the entrance to the first
  accelerating traveling wave structure.}
  \label{fig:fer_match}
\end{figure}

By artificially reproducing this working point as the solution of a
  multi-objective optimization problem given in equations
  (\ref{eq:swissfel:p1}) to (\ref{eq:swissfel:lastdvar}),
  we demonstrate the automation of discovering optimal beam dynamics behaviors
  given a set of desired objectives.

\begin{align}
  \text{min}  \quad & \left[ \Delta \text{rms}_{x,\text{peak}} = \vert 3.0 -
  \text{rms}_{x,\text{peak}} \vert, \right. \label{eq:swissfel:p1}\\
                    & \Delta \varepsilon_{x,\text{peak}}  = \vert 3.0 -
                    \varepsilon_{x,\text{peak}} \vert, \label{eq:swissfel:p2}\\
                    & \left. \vert \text{rms}_{x, \text{peak\_pos}} -
                    \varepsilon_{x,\text{peak\_pos}} \vert
                    \label{eq:swissfel:p3} \right]^T\\
  \text{subject to} \quad & q = 200 \left[\text{pC}\right] \label{eq:swissfel:firstconstr}\\
              \quad & \text{Volt}_{\text{RF}} = 100 \left[\text{MV/m}\right] \label{eq:swissfel:lastconstr}\\
              \quad & \sigma_{L} \leq \sigma_x = \sigma_y \leq \sigma_{U} \label{eq:swissfel:firstdvar}\\
              \quad & \text{KS}_{L} \leq \text{KS}_{\text{RF}} \leq \text{KS}_{U} \label{eq:swissfel:seconddvar}\\
              \quad & \text{LAG}_{L} \leq \text{LAG}_{\text{RF}} \leq \text{LAG}_{U} \\
              \quad & \Delta z_{L\text{KS}} \leq \Delta z_{\text{KS}} \leq \Delta z_{U\text{KS}} \label{eq:swissfel:lastdvar}
\end{align}

The first two objectives minimize the distance from the position of the current
  minimum peak to the expected peak location at $3.0$\,m for transverse bunch
  size (beam waist) and emittance (see Figure~\ref{fig:fer_match}).
The third objective (\ref{eq:swissfel:p3}) adds a condition preferring
  solutions that have their emittance and rms peak locations at the same
  $z$-coordinate.
Equations (\ref{eq:swissfel:firstconstr}) and (\ref{eq:swissfel:lastconstr})
  define constraints for initial conditions for the simulation: charge,
  gun voltage and laser spot size.
Design variables given in (\ref{eq:swissfel:firstdvar}) to
  (\ref{eq:swissfel:lastdvar}) correspond to field strengths of the
  first focusing magnet, its displacement, and the phase of the gun.

In order to compute the peaks, we employed an additional Python script.
This script was called in the \textsc{OPAL}~input file, after the simulation
  finished using the \texttt{SYSTEM} functionality.
Once the peaks (in a given range) were located, the two objectives
  (\ref{eq:swissfel:p1}) and (\ref{eq:swissfel:p2}) were computed and their
  values written into corresponding files.
The custom \texttt{fromFile} functor allows us to access the values stored in
  the peak finder Python script result files

All numerical experiments in this sections were executed on the
  \textsc{Felsim} cluster at PSI\@.
The \textsc{Felsim} cluster consists of 8 dual quad-core Intel Xeon
  processors at 3.0 GHz and has $2$ GB memory per core with a total of 128
  cores.
The nodes are connected via Infiniband network with a total bandwidth of 16
  GB/s.

The envelope-tracker, mentioned in the previous section, was used to evaluate
  the forward problems.
We performed a beam convergence study in order to tune the simulation input
  parameters to achieve the best trade-off between simulation accuracy and
  time to solution.
These parameters include the number of slices (\texttt{NSLICE}) used in the
  envelope-tracker simulations, simulation timestep (\texttt{DT}) and gun
  timestep (\texttt{DTGUN}).

Before the simulation can be executed a number of initial beam optics
  parameters have to be defined in an input file.
Table~\ref{tbl:et_params} shows the values of these parameters for the
  envelope-tracker.
All simulations were performed up to 12.5~m of the
  \textsc{SwissFEL} 250 MeV injector~\cite{pedr:10} beam line, with
  energies reaching  up to 120 MeV.

  \begin{center}
    \caption{Initial conditions for the envelope tracker.}
    \label{tbl:et_params}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
      name & initial value \\
      \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        Gun voltage       & $100$ MV\\
        %Solenoid current & $110.541$ A\\
        %Laser spot size  & $290 \times 10^{-6}$ m in x and y\\
        Bunch charge      & $200$ pC\\
        %DT$_{Gun}$        & $0.06$ ps\\
        DT$_{\text{Beamline}}$  & $1.5$ ps\\
        Number of slices  & $400$ \\
      \noalign{\smallskip}\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

The parameter that affects the performance most is the number of slices.
We scanned the range from $100$ to $1000$ slices to determine the minimal
  number of slices required for stable results using various timesteps.
The results (for 100, 400 and 800 slices) of this scan are shown in
  Figure~\ref{fig:et-dt}.
Using this data we settled for $400$ slices -- increasing the slice number
  only minimally improves convergence of the results, therefore using more
  slices is inefficient.

            %on the exit emittance values.}
   %\label{fig:scan_slices}
%\end{figure}

In a next step the influence of different time steps was examined.
To that end a series of optimization runs with 100, 400 and 800 slices and
  varying timestep was performed.
%Figures \ref{fig:pareto_front_1} and \ref{fig:pareto_front_21} show two Pareto
Figure~\ref{fig:pareto_front_21} shows the Pareto fronts for 400 slices
  respectively using different timesteps.
As expected, increasing the number of slices while lowering the timestep
  produces more detailed results.

\subsubsection{Optimization Results}

Each of the $40$ points on the Pareto front, shown in
  Figure~\ref{fig:pareto_front_21}, represents an optimal solution, where
  emittance and beamsize values are compromised to achieve the best agreement
  with the Ferrario matching point.
We selected individual $3$ based on a comparison of the emittance and beamsize
  characteristics of all solutions and by retaining the feasibility of the
  beam line optics parameters.
The design variables, emittance and beamsize of the selected solution are
  shown in Table~\ref{tbl:des_vars} and Figure~\ref{fig:rmsemit}.
With the multi-objective optimization framework we attain the same working
  point as reported in~\cite{pedr:10}.

\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \caption{The design variables for individual $3$.}
    \label{tbl:des_vars}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
      \hline\noalign{\smallskip}
      name & value \\
      \noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
        $\sigma_{x}$          & $0.262$ mm \\
        Solenoid displacement & $28.8467$ mm \\
        Gun voltage lag       & $0.0159067$ MV\\
        Solenoid current      & $111.426$ A \\
      \noalign{\smallskip}\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Report/iff_plot_emrms}
  \caption{Beamsize and emittance of individual $3$.}
  \label{fig:rmsemit}
\end{figure}

Using the input parameters of the selected solution, we performed a stability
  analysis by varying the slice number and the time step for both the gun and
  the beam line.
Figure~\ref{fig:et-dt} shows that the exit emittance stabilizes for 400
  slices and various time steps.
No difference between $800$ and $400$ slices is visible as their minimum
  maximum extension seems to be in the same range of $0.024$ mm~mrad.

For validation purposes we compared the results of the envelope-tracker using
  the analytical space charge model with the \textsc{OPAL} 3D macro particle
  tracker.
The benchmark was run on the first 12.5 meters of the \textsc{SwissFEL} 250
  MeV injector.
The results for both rms beamsize and emittance are shown in
  Figure~\ref{fig:et-vs-tt}.
A good agreement between the two codes can be observed.
The difference of the larger emittance along the solenoids in case of 3D
  tracker that is not seen by the envelope-tracker is due to the different
  definition of the particle momenta (canonical vs.~mechanical).
Both trackers agree within acceptable limits \cite{chao:99}.

Next we apply the optimization framework to an ongoing project in accelerator physics.
The model is taken from the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility, which 
houses two rf photoinjector beam lines. We consider the high charge beam line
that consists of an rf photocathode gun, two solenoids, six linear accelerating cavities,
